#python wokwie integration 

step 1.install wokwie and platformio extension 

step 2.pip install -U platformio

step 3.pio run

step 4.open diagram.json and press play

step 5.cd python and run the python code with python3 script.py if its debian linux or 
python script.py otherwise. That should rotate the motor 90 degrees at first and -90 degrees the second time you run the script. 

I did come across a few problems while setting it up but im assuming the config files are set
so it will no longer be a problem. Put up an issue and let me know. 

Protip:Every time you save run pio run just in case also maybe close vscode and open it again. 

#why is this important?

Because we can use python code to interact with the motors which means visual or voice recognition among other things later on.
